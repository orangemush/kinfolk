This issue of Kinfolk explores the balance between our contradictory cravings for both secure and stable relationships and the freedom to follow our hearts, our sexual desires, and our need to be whole without the help of another. We take psychotherapist Esther Perel as our lodestar. It’s a role she’s played for the clients at her New York practice and for millions of others through her books and the podcast Where Should We Begin, which offers the chance to listen in on anonymous couples during therapy sessions. Perel’s approach has always been to challenge the fundamental contradictions in how we think about romantic intimacy: Is it really feasible to expect one person to fulfill our every need—for the rest of our life?\nIn Issue Thirty-Four, we experience the thrill of people and places spilling their secrets. Amaryllis Fox—an ex-CIA spy who spent her 20s negotiating in some of the world’s most dangerous conflict zones—cracks open the mysteries of the Clandestine Service, and what they’ve taught her about peace. We also present the result of our own months-long international operation: To gain access to an art deco royal palace in Gujurat, India. As the nights close in, our contributors look beyond this world and into other more mysterious ones: They mull over the popularity of horoscopes and what to eat at funerals. Elsewhere, a photo essay by Gustav Almestål explores the solitary indulgence of comfort foods, so tied to our most intimate of spaces—our homes—and so appealing during break ups.','\'192 pages, offset-printed and perfect bound, full color on uncoated and coated paper.

Power should not equal knowledge, but the financial burden of higher education often makes it so. Meanwhile, students who do make it to college are under pressure to approach “book learning” with a tunnel vision that steamrolls more creative ways of thinking. This issue of Kinfolk rejects the definition of a good education as one that ends with good grades.\nIn putting together our fall issue, we considered education as a lifelong pursuit: What can we learn about our bodies, minds, beliefs and societies, and who can teach us? In Los Angeles, we meet Erica Chidi Cohen, the co-founder of Loom—specializing in schooling its (adult) students on bodies, healthcare and better sex. For Chidi Cohen, this new pedagogy is a response to political failures. “If we can’t get people healthcare, we need to get them education,” she says.\nThe people we meet in Issue Thirty-Three prove just how many different paths can lead you to a meaningful career. Montreal-based producer Kaytranada found success so early that he never finished high school, whereas Belgian painter Michaël Borremans spent a decade working as a teacher prior to becoming an acclaimed figurative artist. And some people manage to sidestep the idea of a “calling” altogether: Waris Ahluwalia has funneled his bonhomie into being an actor, model, jewelry designer and activist. Elsewhere there are bubbles, puzzles and a fashion editorial that takes the form of an all-night party. As Ahluwalia reminds us: “We’re all dying. But if we can do it while we’re dancing?”','\'192 pages, offset-printed and perfect bound, full color on uncoated and coated paper.

In fact, since 2013, the magazine-and its ongoing exploration of quality of life – has been translated into Japanese at our sister office in the heart of Shibuya, Tokyo. On our most recent visit in March, local editors Mako Ayabe and Kota Engaku reminded us what life in the Japanese capital is like for those living there with a sense of intention and energy: one of the navigable neighbourhoods, courteous codes and cutting-edge culture. This is in stark contrast to the vision of Tokyo as a city that can feel impenetrable to the outsider.\nFor our 18-page guide, our photographer Romain Laprade and local writer Selena Hoy took recommendations from our Japan team and visited a dozen locations that, between them, paint a full picture of this varied metropolis: from a new rice specialist revitalizing a shuttered shopping district, to a store inside a house in upmarket, residential Shirokane. For our archive and feature profiles, we’ve chosen two women who made Tokyo their home a hundred years apart: Toko Shinoda, the 106-year-old abstract artist who still lives in the city center, and Yoon Ahn, the Korean designer who moved to the city in the early aughts, riding the peak of the city’s street-style wave.\nPerhaps because Tokyo is the world’s most populous metropolis, spending time in the city left us longing for space to stretch out and enjoy the summer. Our issue Thirty-Two fashion shoot takes place on a boat off the coast of Marseille, and our feature profile of Coco O tells the story of how the singer found room to breathe again by moving back to Copenhagen after several years in Los Angeles. And, in interviews with the architects Kengo Kuma and Bijoy Jain, we discover a common reverence for creating building in conversation with the nature and light that surrounds them.','\'192 pages, offset-printed and perfect bound, full color on uncoated and coated paper.

Mid-century architect and furniture designer Charlotte Perriand, whose archives we delve into in this issue, once wrote: “The extension of the art of dwelling is the art of living.” We interrogate this close relationship between external surroundings and interior well-being and meet the architects chipping away at the partition wall between the two.\nElsewhere in the issue, we meet Sharon Van Etten, who talks about why she chose to study psychology while writing her new album, and we spend a day in rehearsals with Kyle Abraham—the choreographer making history at New York City Ballet. Writer Ellie Violet Bramley explores the history of marriage, narrating the changing nature of an institution no longer wedded to the idea that death us do part; composer Ryuichi Sakamoto describes the creativity that comes when considering his own mortality; and palliative care expert BJ Miller proposes a new meditation with which we might all rethink the inevitable.\nAs the weather becomes warmer, we turn our faces upward—and toward a cheerier outlook for spring; this issue’s essays also find our writers lingering on balconies, musing on the contradictions of “turning over a new leaf” and biting into the juicy mythology of the peach.','\'192 pages, offset-printed and perfect bound, full color on uncoated and coated paper.

Featuring a special section dedicated to the art of hosting, Issue Thirty looks beyond recipe repertoires and honed housekeeping to unearth the secret ingredients of having a good time.\nDrilling down into the heart of hospitality, we investigate its five pillars: acceptance, comfort, empathy, entertainment and trust. How has the rise in peer-to-peer services such as Airbnb changed our relationship to having strangers in our home? Does a lack of formality translate into a more comfortable environment, or do subtle rules actually make it easier for people to know how to behave? And, how do you get a guest to leave?\nWe receive expert advice on hospitality from leading hoteliers, culinary artists, salon hosts and party planners, and meet wunderkind chef Flynn McGarry—host of New Yorker-reviewed dinner parties since the age of thirteen. Elsewhere, we speak to actress Teyonah Parris—star of the forthcoming James Baldwin adaptation If Beale Street Could Talk—explore seasonal subjects such as hunkering down, hometowns and ghost stories, plus much more.','\'192 pages, offset-printed and perfect bound, full color on uncoated and coated paper.
